# Up and running

The aim of this guide is to explain how EctoNeo4j works with a full example.  

Neo4j is required, so if you haven't installed it yet, get it at https://neo4j.com/download/.

Be sure to have a running database with the following credentials:  
- login: `neo4j`
- password: `graph_app_pass`

## Unsupported features
Not all `Ecto` features are supported, either because they aren't implemented yet in `EctoNeo4j` or because they-re irrelevant in a graph context.  
  
Unsupported features:
- subqueries: complicated to translate them in `WITH` terms  
- streams: will be supported
- migration: only some parts are supported, other are irrelevant as Neo4j is schemaless

## The Project: GraphApp
We are going to build a backend to manage the data for a blog application.  
The model will be as follow:  
![GrapApp Model](../assets/model.png) 
 
a `User` can only have one `UserProfile`.  
a `User` can write multiple `Posts`.  
a `User` can read multiple `Posts`.
a `User` can write multiple `Comments`.  
a `Post` can have multiple `Comments`.  

`User` properties:
- firstName
- lastName

`UserProfile` properties:
- avatarUrl
- age

`Post` properties:
- title
- text

`Comment` properties:
- text

`:WROTE` (from `User` to `Post`, and from `User` to `Comment`) properties:
- when

### Create the application
We create our supervised application via
```bash
mix new --sup graph_app
* creating README.md
* creating .formatter.exs
...
* creating test/graph_app_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd graph_app
    mix test

Run "mix help" for more commands.
```

Now, we can add our dependencies in `mix.exs`:  
```elixir
# mix.exs
defp deps do
    [
      {:ecto, "~> 3.2"},
      {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.2"},
      {:ecto_neo4j, "~> 0.6"}
    ]
  end
```
and
```bash
mix do deps get, compile
```
### Configuration
It's time to define our Repo and to add its config.  
Open `config/config.exs` and add:  
```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :graph_app, ecto_repos: [GraphApp.Repo]
```

We add the repo config (as we would do with any ecto adapters):
```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :graph_app, GraphApp.Repo,
  hostname: 'localhost',
  basic_auth: [username: "neo4j", password: "graph_app_pass"],
  port: 7687
```

We create our repo module:  
```elixir
# lib/graph_app/repo.ex
defmodule GraphApp.Repo do
  use Ecto.Repo, otp_app: :graph_app, adapter: Ecto.Adapters.Neo4j
end
```

And we don't forget to add to our application supervisor:
```elixir
# lib/graph_app/application
def start(_type, _args) do
  # List all child processes to be supervised
  children = [
    GraphApp.Repo
  ]
  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: GraphApp.Supervisor]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
end
```

Now, we can make our first query in `iex` to test that everything has been well configured:  
```elixir
iex -S mix
iex> Ecto.Adapters.Neo4j.query!("RETURN 1 AS num")
%Bolt.Sips.Response{
  bookmark: "neo4j:bookmark:v1:tx1",
  fields: ["num"],
  notifications: [],
  plan: nil,
  profile: nil,
  records: [[1]],
  results: [%{"num" => 1}],
  stats: [],
  type: "r"
}
```

### Formating
`EctoNeo4j` has functions with custom formating.  
Be sure to get these benefits by addin this to your `.formatter.exs`:
```elixir
# .formatter.exs
...
import_deps: [:ecto_neo4j]
...
```
